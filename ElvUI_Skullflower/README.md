# ElvUI_Skullflower
This is modified [Skullflower's UI](http://www.tukui.org/addons/index.php?act=view&id=145) (from [tukui.org](http://www.tukui.org/blog/)) that is working with Patch 6.2.4 and newest ElvUI.

This UI is belong to Skullflower who is the original author. Since the addon hasn't been updated from Feb. 27. 2015, the minimap panel and DataText options stopped working with the newest changes of ElvUI. I modified it to make it work, at least for me. 

LUA and XML is never my master programming languages, I can understand it but I never got time to learn and understand the WoW API and ElvUI libraries, I want to but my time table is tight with real life. So this is just a fix not an "improved" version. It just looks like what it should be without new features.
